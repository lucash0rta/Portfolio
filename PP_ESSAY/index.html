    <h1>Professional Practice Essay - Lucas Horta</h1>

    <p>Throughout the following paper I will overview the preliminary research I have undertaken to gain a broader perspective of the creative industries locally and internationally and how they apply to my career prospects and personal aspirations.</p>

    <h2>Personal Introduction</h2>

    <p>Throughout my time trying to progress and learning what I want to pursue for my career I have come across different pathways and have explored different options; I acknowledge my inexperience as I have not worked professionally as a part of a larger team within the creative industries before however.</p>

    <p>In the past I have run club nights, ran promotional material, shot advertisements for restaurants, managed Facebook ad spend accounts and targeting for businesses, marketed a small-scale print magazine and worked on 3D animation and VFX for several music videos. Despite these achievements, I often worked long hours for minimal pay, with the most I earned being $1,000. I also realised I don't have the appetite for managing a social media account, tailoring and advertising my services as I try to create content that I think might get me the freelance job I'm after.</p>

    <p>I would like to work on a creative team; developing branding or advertisements across mediums such as interactive displays, games, social media marketing campaigns, animations etc;  putting my skills to use as I explore my personal interests in politics, arts and digital media in my down time.  During the Covid years I worked for Westpac as a telephone operator. The routine shaped my life and made me better for it. I discovered I thrive with a solid routine therefor believe the pathway of employment is for me.</p>

    <h2>Portfolio</h2>

    <p>I have been developing my portfolio and working on how I would like it to appear aesthetically; Currently I am coding my own html site with a helping hand from various LLM's. This process helps me to iterate quickly and then decide how I want to refine the ideas.</p>

    <p>I will layout below some of the attempts I have been working through.</p>

    <p>Current Idea - <a href="https://lucash0rta.github.io/Portfolio/PP_PortfolioSite_RightPrev/index.html">https://lucash0rta.github.io/Portfolio/PP_PortfolioSite_RightPrev/index.html</a></p>

    <p>Prior Progress - More of a plain mockup - <a href="https://lucash0rta.github.io/Portfolio/PP_PortfolioSite_Plain/index.html">https://lucash0rta.github.io/Portfolio/PP_PortfolioSite_Plain/index.html</a></p>

    <p>Earlier Mockup from a previous design - This mockup feels very busy and therefor I plan to steer clear from this. Personally I think It looks a bit childish and I would like my portfolio work to be professional in how I represent it andcome across. <a href="https://lucash0rta.github.io/im2350/The%20portfolio%20new/index.html">https://lucash0rta.github.io/im2350/The%20portfolio%20new/index.html</a></p>

    <h2>Research</h2>

    <p>I have been researching potential business opportunities both locally in Melbourne and internationally, as well as considering master's degrees in Europe once I have saved enough money. Below, I will outline the companies I have investigated.</p>

    <h3>Phoria</h3>

    <p>Phoria, located in Melbourne, Australia, specializes in VR and AR content. They have notable projects including collaborations with Netflix and David Attenborough. Potential roles at Phoria could include VR Developer, 3D Artist, or Creative Technologist, with an average salary ranging from 68k to 72k AUD, according to GlassDoor.com.au.</p>

    <p>Recently I attended a showcase at Mebourne University titled "The Future of Entertainment" where I had the opportunity to meet the CEO and some of the developers. The CEO, Trent even added me on LinkedIn. I learned that Phoria frequently works with student interns, and after speaking with some of the employees and nerding out on some Unity XR questions I had after seeing their projects they encouraged me to enquire and to send them some videos of my relevant works.</p>

    <h3>Liminal VR</h3>

    <p>Liminal VR is a VR company based in Melbourne; the companies main title is their self titled Liminal VR Application for various headsets ran locally and through PC VR. I first heard about company in 2021 when I purchased a Meta Quest 2 and tried their application; I found their app interesting but disconnected. I don't have much faith in the intersection of mental health and VR; personally I don't see it necessary and a step  in the wrong direction.</p>

    <p>The agency is mostly working from home. I've heard from other students who have interned with them that their work was entirely remote. I'm happy to make sacrifices to get my foot in the door and would be more than willing to take on a role with them, despite any personal grievances with their work style and philosophy.</p>

    <h3>Studio Brave Melbourne</h3>

    <p>Studio Brave Melbourne is a local marketing and ad agency that handles the full stack from photos to PR packs, branding, and web design. I admire this full stack approach to a design agency and their previous clientele are quite impressive, from Vic Screen, Melbourne Opera, construction Agencies and corporate restaurants. Studio Brave stands out as a studio that reflects Melbourne's hipster millennial aesthetic without trying too hard. They seem adaptable to a wide range of brands and seeing as they work through a large range of mediums including 3D motion graphics, creatively coded websites, video edits, photography, and magazine print design. This agency seems like it could be the perfect fit if by a chance they would take me I could see this as a space to try to prove myself and hone my craft across mediums.</p>

    <h3>Rising Sun Pictures</h3>

    <p>I first heard of Rising Sun Pictures (RSP) during my brief VFX course at TAFE SA. the VFX Agency offer a education pipeline through the local university and into Internships. They are one of the greatest studios in Oceania for VFX and have worked on numerous high-profile projects, including Marvel films and later Harry Potter movies.</p>

    <p>Glassdoor salaries for RSP show VFX artists earning $63,000-$95,000, with senior roles up to $110,000. VFX work is demanding, involving long hours and repetitive tasks. Junior roles often have limited creative freedom and face frequent critique within the VFX industry.</p>

    <p>RSP and UniSA offer 12-week graduate certificates in 3D Animation, Creature Effects and Compositing and Tracking, providing opportunities to enhance technical skills for career advancement in VFX. I could see a pathway where I moved back home to Adelaide If I was unsuccesful in finding work at a creative advertising agency, persuing this graduate programming and a role at Rising Sun.</p>

    <h3>SuperBright Studios</h3>

    <p>I also conducted some research into two international brands that more suit the sort of company I would ideally work with later in my career.</p>

    <p>One being superbright studios, based in New York and and London the agency was founded in 2013 by Igal Nassima an NYU adjunct professor, engineer and artist. The studio specialises in AR, VR, VFX and animation; the studio has catered to a range of clients across filmmakers, artists and brands. The studio gave birth to Vortic an AR platform offering customised XR and VR solutions to galleries. I have a specific interest in this area and especially surrounding digital curation and experimental web based immersive experiences. Through this as I had noted in my presentation they have worked along side the likes of Frieze Art Magazine and an array of public galleries / institutions such as the Barbican centre in London. There are no publicly available listings for wages and I would be left to guess, as this work sits at the intersection of large institutions with enormous budgets and a small boutique design studio. Regardless of pay this intersection is one that I am keenly interested in and hope to one day be able to venture into.</p>

    <h3>Zeitguised</h3>

    <p>ZEITGUISED is a berlin based agency founded in 2001 by Henrik Mauler. The teamseems to be quite small with only 3 members on linkedin as employees; their previous work sits somewhere in the clean motion graphics, NFT's, brand-image,m advertisement space. With a techy berlin feel distinctly different and much friendlier than the typical harsher aesthetics that are prevalent in the cities arts scene. After backpacking europe last year I walked away from berlin feeling like it is a city that many people lose themselves in; however for the few that keep their head mostly on straight the opportunities in the cities, many incredible local galleries that are well renowned and a hotbed for contemporary art the city could be an incredible place to live and work for a couple years. The studio often works on textile, pattern focused and materially intense works some notable previous collaborations include; The Wrong Bienniel, Alicia Keys and Virgin Voyages (the airline).</p>

    <h3>Reflection on Research</h3>

    <p>Reflecting on my research into various workplaces within and outside melbourne I realise I must be committed to polishing my portfolio and continually putting myself out there. I am somewhat a realist and pessimist and feel as though the work I have produced throughout this course is not targetted enough to land a fantastic job; however I am not looking for the fantastic job. I hope to find a workplace that suits me, that I can help bring new ideas to the table through my experience of working in 3d and game engines. I hope I can find a team whom I can get behind. And while I begin my career maybe doing menial tasks nobody else wants to do like cleaning up compositing layers, retopologising 3d assets or testing variations for an artistic director I hope to save money and persue my personal interests and practice inmy spare time.</p>

    <p>This leads me to the final section.</p>

    <h3>Discord reading groups, online courses and Conferences</h3>

    <p>I have outlined in my reflection that I aim to work, save and persue further education; I will lay out briefly a plan.</p>

    <p>Maintain ongoing involvement in DNR (DoNotResearch); DNR is a small discord community ran by ex NYU professor and Twitch streamer Joshua Citarella. I have been a lurker in the twitch and discord chats for the past two years; through this time I have seen the group grow and they have now published two books, organised a couple gallery shows and have just recently although unannounced set up a non profit and a grant system for artists to receive funding. The commitments mainly involve reading the syllabus and sometimes their is a reading group; however individuals can take on more responsibility if they are more engaged. Organising readings, meetings, peer review meetups etc.</p>

    <p>Outside of this I am in several other discord channels both within australia and outside of australia that sporadically run reading groups or meetups; I aim to continue my involvement in these.</p>

    <p>During June / July break I took part in the MYCOCOSM studio ran by Neal Haslem and Chris Henshcke through RMIT; two of the lectureres wee from the partner university of the course ELISAVA Barcelona; I was impressed by their passion and bredth of thinking.  ELISAVA offer several masters programs. The main reason why I have come to want to study overseas aswell is that the coursework Masters program through RMIT is not supported by the HECS loan scheme; I cannot afford to pay upfront; I dont have any money andso if I am to pay for a course It will be cheaper in europe as I will be able to receive discounts as I will be an EU citizen through family heritage. There are also other opportunities such as short courses or bootcamps such as NØ SCHOOL NEVERS; a 3 week summer program in Nevers, Burgundy aimed at researchers, hackers, makers, designers to meet new people and get inspired.</p>

    <p>I also hope to attend as many international showcases or conferences as possible; including but not limited to; XCOAX, ISEA, SIGGRAPH, SIGGRAPH Asia, Unsound (Krakow, Poland)</p>
