    <h1>Research Overview</h1>

    <p>Throughout the following paper I will overview the preliminary research I have undertaken to gain a broader perspective of the creative industries locally and internationally and how they apply to my career prospects and personal aspirations.</p>

    <h2>Personal Introduction</h2>

    <p>Prior to beginning the course I had tried my hand at working freelance; promoting and curating club nights, running facebook ad campaign optimisations for this club night, attempted to create a small magazine with friends and worked as a 3d animator for various music videos for australian artists. The work was long hours and minimal pay. I acknowledge I was very young and that the difference in professionalism and skills could change this narrative and there could be opportunities to aspire for a career as a freelancer. However this experience was fun at the time I wish to pursue a stable entrance into the design industry through company and standard career pathways.</p>

    <p>I would like to work on a creative team; developing branding or advertisements across mediums such as interactive displays, games, social media marketing campaigns, animations etc;  putting my skills to use as I explore my personal interests in politics, arts and digital media in my down time.</p>

    <h2>Portfolio</h2>

    <p>I have been developing my portfolio and working on how I would like it to appear aesthetically and through that reflect who I am; 
    Currently I am coding my own html site with a helping hand from various LLM's. This process helps me to iterate quickly and then decide how I want to refine the ideas.</p>

    <p>I have been undergoing a process of refining how I wish to shape my website. I wish to show off my work without creating a site that is excessively loud or showy. I would like to introduce subtle but impressive creative coding techniques and interaction effects.</p>

    <p>Below are three of the iterations I have been working through from the most recent to a previous portfolio I had created.</p>

    <p>Current Idea - <a href="https://lucash0rta.github.io/Portfolio/PP_PortfolioSite_RightPrev/index.html">https://lucash0rta.github.io/Portfolio/PP_PortfolioSite_RightPrev/index.html</a></p>

    <p>Prior Progress - More of a plain mockup - <a href="https://lucash0rta.github.io/Portfolio/PP_PortfolioSite_Plain/index.html">https://lucash0rta.github.io/Portfolio/PP_PortfolioSite_Plain/index.html</a></p>

    <p>Earlier Mockup from a previous design - This mockup feels very busy and therefor I plan to steer clear from this.

    <h2>Research</h2>

    <p>I have been researching potential employers in Melbourne and internationally for post-graduation applications. Below, I will outline the companies I have investigated.</p>

    <h3>Phoria</h3>

    <p>Phoria, located in Melbourne, Australia, Phoria specializes in VR and AR content. They have notable projects including collaborations with Netflix and David Attenborough. Potential roles at Phoria could include VR Developer, 3D Artist, or Creative Technologist, with an average salary ranging from 68k to 72k AUD, according to GlassDoor.com.au.</p>

    <p>Recently I attended a showcase at Mebourne University titled "The Future of Entertainment" where I had the opportunity to meet the CEO and some of the developers. The CEO, Trent even added me on LinkedIn. I learned that Phoria frequently works with student interns, and after speaking with some of the employees and nerding out with them on their unity XR development techniques they encouraged me to enquire and to send them videos of my relevant works.</p>

    <h3>Liminal VR</h3>

    <p>Liminal VR is a VR company based in Melbourne; the companies main product is their self titled Liminal VR Application. I first heard about company in 2021 when I purchased a Meta Quest 2 and tried their application; I found their app interesting but disconnected. I don't have much faith in the intersection of mental health and VR; personally I don't see it necessary and a step  in the wrong direction.</p>

    <p>The agency is mostly working from home. I've heard from other students who have interned with them that their work was entirely remote. I'm happy to make sacrifices to get my foot in the door and would be more than willing to take on a role with them, despite any personal grievances with their work style and philosophy.</p>

    <h3>Studio Brave Melbourne</h3>

    <p>Studio Brave Melbourne is a local marketing and ad agency that handles the full stack from photos to PR packs, branding, and web design. I admire this full stack approach to a design agency and their previous clientele are quite impressive, from Vic Screen, Melbourne Opera, construction Agencies and corporate restaurants. Studio Brave stands out as a studio that reflects Melbourne's hipster millennial aesthetic without trying too hard. They seem adaptable to a wide range of brands and seeing as they work through a large range of mediums including 3D motion graphics, creatively coded websites, video edits, photography and magazine print. This agency seems like it could be the perfect fit; I could see this as a space to hone my craft across mediums.</p>

    <h3>Rising Sun Pictures</h3>

    <p>I first heard of Rising Sun Pictures (RSP) during my brief VFX course at TAFE SA. the VFX Agency offer a education pipeline through the local university and into Internships. They are one of the greatest studios in Oceania for VFX and have worked on numerous high-profile projects, including Marvel films and later Harry Potter movies.</p>

    <p>Glassdoor salaries for RSP show VFX artists earning $63,000-$95,000, with senior roles up to $110,000. VFX work is demanding, involving long hours and repetitive tasks. Junior roles often have limited creative freedom and face frequent critique within the VFX industry.</p>

    <p>RSP and UniSA offer 12-week graduate certificates in 3D Animation, Creature Effects and Compositing and Tracking, providing opportunities to enhance technical skills for career advancement in VFX. I could see a pathway where I moved back home to Adelaide If I was unsuccessful in finding work at a creative advertising agency, perusing this graduate programming and a role at Rising Sun.</p>

    <h3>SuperBright Studios</h3>

    <p>I also explored two international studios that align with my long term aspirations.</p>

    <p>One being superbright studios, based in New York and and London the agency was founded in 2013 by Igal Nassima an NYU adjunct professor, engineer and artist. The studio specialises in AR, VR, VFX and animation; the studio has catered to a range of clients across filmmakers, artists and brands. The studio gave birth to Vortic an AR platform offering customised XR and VR solutions to galleries. I have a specific interest in this area and especially surrounding digital curation and experimental web based immersive experiences. Through this as I had noted in my presentation they have worked along side the likes of Frieze Art Magazine and an array of public galleries / institutions such as the Barbican centre in London. There are no publicly available listings for wages and I would be left to guess, as this work sits at the intersection of large institutions with enormous budgets and a small boutique design studio. Regardless of pay this intersection is one that I am keenly interested in and hope to one day be able to venture into.</p>

    <h3>ZEITGUISED</h3>

    <p>ZEITGUISED is a berlin based agency founded in 2001 by Henrik Mauler. The teamseems to be quite small with only 3 members on linkedin as employees; their previous work sits somewhere in the clean motion graphics, NFT's, brand-image,m advertisement space. With a techy berlin feel distinctly different and much friendlier than the typical harsher aesthetics that are prevalent in the cities arts scene. After backpacking europe last year I walked away from berlin feeling like it is a city that many people lose themselves in; however for the few that keep their head mostly on straight the opportunities in the cities, many incredible local galleries that are well renowned and a hotbed for contemporary art the city could be an incredible place to live and work for a couple years. The studio often works on textile, pattern focused and materially intense works some notable previous collaborations include; The Wrong Bienniel, Alicia Keys and Virgin Voyages (the airline).</p>

    <h3>Reflection on Research</h3>

    <p>Reflecting on my research into workplaces in Melbourne and internationally I realise I must be committed to polishing my portfolio and continually shape my online identity. I am somewhat a pessimist and feel as though the work I have produced throughout this course is not targeted enough to land a fantastic job; however I am not looking for the fantastic job. I hope to find a workplace that suits me, that I can help bring new ideas to the table through my experience of working in 3d and game engines. I hope to join a team I support, starting with an entry level role while saving money and pursuing personal interests in my free time.</p>

    <h3>Discord reading groups, online courses and Conferences</h3>

    <p>I have outlined in my reflection that I aim to work, save and pursue further education; I will lay out briefly a plan.</p>

    <p>Maintain ongoing involvement in DNR (DoNotResearch); DNR is a small discord community ran by ex NYU professor and Twitch streamer Joshua Citarella. I have been a lurker in the twitch and discord chats for the past two years; through this time I have seen the group grow and they have now published two books, organised a couple gallery shows and have just recently although unannounced set up a non profit and a grant system for artists to receive funding. 
    The involve following a syllabus and participating in a reading group; however individuals can take on more responsibility if they are more engaged. Organising readings, meetings, peer reviews, meetups etc.</p>

    <p>Outside of this I am in several other discord channels both within Australia and outside of Australia that sporadically run reading groups or meetups; I aim to continue my involvement in these.</p>

    <p>During the June/July break, I participated in the MYCOCOSM studio at RMIT, led by Neal Haslem and Chris Henschke, which included lecturers from partner university ELISAVA Barcelona. I was impressed by the ELISAVA proffessors passion and breadth of thinking.  ELISAVA offer several masters programs. I have come to aspire to study overseas as the coursework Masters program through RMIT is not supported by the HECS loan scheme; As a potential EU citizen through family heritage, studying in Europe will be more affordable and an exciting opportunity. There are also other opportunities such as short courses or bootcamps such as NØ SCHOOL NEVERS; a 3 week summer program in Nevers, Burgundy aimed at researchers, hackers, makers, designers to meet new people and get inspired.</p>

    <p>I also hope to attend as many international showcases or conferences as possible; including but not limited to; XCOAX, ISEA, SIGGRAPH, SIGGRAPH Asia, Unsound (Krakow, Poland)</p>

    <h2>Career Development and Social Media</h2>

    <p>Throughout my practice and research development I've recognized the importance of maintaining various social media streams to promote my work</p>

    <p>I have aimed to use visual images and aesthetics through my instagram posting to display the type of Artist/Designer I am. On Instagram, I've curated my feed to represent an experimental visual aesthetic and reflect my 3D design work, featuring renders and works in progress. I decided to ask ChatGPT what type of person it thought I was from a screenshot of my account. It described me as;</p>

    <p><em>"a person with a strong interest in digital art, surrealism, and possibly experimental or avant-garde aesthetics, blending both human and abstract forms with a unique, perhaps slightly dystopian, futuristic vibe."</em> - Chat-GPT4</p>

    <p>For professional networking, I use LinkedIn; recently as apart of my effort to work on my online professional appearance I asked, past collaborator; Dr Stephanie Andrews to leave a reference on my Linkedin page in regards to the VR art work we made together. She kindly obliged; I believe this makes my profile appear more credible.</p>
