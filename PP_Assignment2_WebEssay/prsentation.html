<!--  Personal Portfolio progress   -->
<div class="infoCard">
  <h2>Part 1.5 – PORTFOLIO</h2>
  <p>To briefly overview, I have been progressively working on my portfolio. I had to get most of it done prior to August 31st as there was a deadline for an artist residency that I applied for.</p>
  <p>Since then, I have successfully acquired and set up a custom domain name so now my site is available at <a href="http://lucashorta.com">lucashorta.com</a>.</p>
  <h3>Github Limitations</h3>
  <p>Github has a limitation on their pages sites:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Github – CSS, HTML, JS etc. – restrictions on file upload size, so no storage of media</li>
      <li>IMGUR, Flickr, YouTube – free external hosting</li>
      <li>Domain - $23 per year</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This took some tinkering with custom DNS settings, but I’m glad I got this to work at a minimal cost.</p>

  <h1>Social Media Progress</h1>

  <div id="summary">
      <p>After the gallery show, I went back to the site and took some photos to share with the other artists from the curated show at Blindside. Recent exposure, as well as meeting people at reading groups, has led to a large increase in followers over the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>On my business dashboard, you can see that I gained 52 followers but also lost 20 followers. This is probably due to people who followed years ago and haven't seen me in their feed for a while.</p>

    <title>Case Study – Joshua Citarella</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Case Study – Joshua Citarella</h1>

    <div>
        <p>Originally when thinking about the case study assignment I had in mind</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Henry Lai-Pyne - Psuedo Studio and Independent Artist.</li>
            <li>Trent Clews-de Castella – PHORIA – VR and Management / Entrepeneur.</li>
            <li>Thorsten Hertog– Soft Centre – Event Management, Curator, Creative Producer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I decided that despite these creative people having very interesting and inspiring career trajectories, creative outcomes and impressive resumes that they did not fit the direction off where I have been and plan to go.</p>
        <p>There is one person that kept coming up as I was meeting people, discussing, contemporary art, the terminally online and cultural theory over the past few weeks across some various events. This name was Joshua Citarella; artist, academic, author, twitch streamer, fitness influencer, podcast host, discord moderator…..</p>
        <p>Joshua studied both traditional darkroom photography and digital techniques through a photography focused BFA at the School of Visual Arts in New York. Joshua after graduation worked within marketing which has its influence on some of his early career works; notably his series "Fashion Painting" and eCommorce Drawings</p>

      <h2>The Jogging and Net Art</h2>
        <p>Prior to these paintings in 2009 at 22 years old Joshua Citarella started The Jogging alongside fellow artist Brad Troemel; a popular net art blog site and originator of odd viral pictures circulating in the early 2010s.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/thejogging">https://www.tumblr.com/thejogging</a></p>
        <p>Brad troemel speaks on the thinking behind The Jogging in his essay "The Accidental Audience," published in The New Inquiry on March 14, 2013 .</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Jogging began as a Tumblr in 2009 that displayed Google Image Searched products Photoshopped together as artworks, with the same text you'd find on any museum wall placard: title, date, medium, and author. Discrepancies would arise between the visual content and the descriptions, as digital collages were variously titled as installations, paintings, or sculptures, raising questions about the leveling effects of installation photography on all mediums and the power that documentary images have over the physical objects they depict."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/indy/ckeditor/content/514/brad.jpg" alt="">
        <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/7f16c6239c9db0a42a46a486b81c3fe8/tumblr_msp8rjKjbS1qzcdbeo1_1280.jpg" alt="">

    </div>
<h2>Virality</h2>
    <div>
        <p>The virality / popularity of The Jogging played a crucial role in Joshua and Brads career trajectory establishing themselves in the art world through Tumblr. This stands as a point of inspiration. There is a need for digital performance as an artist; that the inst posts, tags, comments, shares etc. are a part of the performance and not just that but can lead to a beneficial outcome where in this case it poured jet fuel onto their careers.</p>
        <p>I could go through and analyse each of his works and how they link together however I don't believe that to be the purpose of this research.</p>
        <p>There is a key ideology underpinning joshuas ability to move across digital space, performing an identity and exploring interesting ideas, creating, conducting research along the way. As for the practice of making this ideology is somewhat best reflected in this quote from 2013.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"The contemporary means of image production unprecedentedly lend themselves to the transmutation of signs. RGB pixels are implicated as new prima material delivering objects from the dim confines of materiality into omnipresent electronic radiance. A global network of images has transfigured all bodies and materials into exchanges of energy. The world is now transcribed through photography in order to be reconfigured with graphics-editing software and transformed into its ideal state. While this universal translation space now allows for an alchemical magnum opus, it has consequently democratized all materials transmuting lead into gold and vice versa. We lose sight of the interface and are carried away in the fervor of a transcendent promise fulfilled.' - Joshua Citarella" (christopherschreck, 2013)</p>
        </blockquote>
    </div>
 

    <div>
      <h2>Reflections
      </h2>
        <p>The underlying idea that can be extracted from this is that the transmutability of the image, objects, sculptures through 3d space, photoshop etc can be a means of breaking out of restrictions whether of showcasing works irl; ie photoshoping them into a gallery space or physically by utilising print or photoshop to make use of materials that would cost money irl.</p>
        <p>This mentality paired with the mentality of performing online as an artist that brad troemel goes into is one of the key aspects of Joshua Citarellas practice that I hope to integrate into my own.</p>
        <p>As noted in my slides –</p>
        <p><strong>Regular instagram posting as ideology ; the jogging ; clout, shitposting and playing the game</strong></p>

    <h2>Part 2 – Networking</h2>

    <div>
        <p>Above on my slides you can take note that I outlined all the events that I have attended in brief. Therefor below I will supply my notes that I wrote out in preparation for the presentation.</p>
        <h3>Soft Centre Reading Group</h3>
        <p>My friend Audrey who I met on discord about 2 years ago, was the first online person I met and only knew them by their discord handle lol, had to like say I'm wearing "black hoodie and whatever outfit" to be recognisable. Audrey works for UnMagazine and works throughout the arts.</p>
        <p>This reading group ran between the 7th and 28th of august in the lead up to the Soft Centre : New Models show and discourse lineup.</p>
        <p>This reading group was a great way to chat with people about these different texts, pulling from the same syllabus we had some very rich dialogue.</p>
        <p>One of my other friends I've met from online a few times; said damn, I'd never really heard you speak about these readings, i was like damn you've really been lurking., I think it was a good space as these intertextual refrences and contexts through these texts are ideas I surround mysself with in readings in the past and through other online spaces.</p>
        <p>Most People have anonymopus usernames but I know the organisers were in the chat and some friends from melbourne and brisbane.</p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HOn9yYk.png" alt="Firas Shadeh in the voice chat for the reading group">
        <p>Here is a screenshot where the artist Firas Shehadeh the creator of Like an event in a dream dreamt by another spoke and we were able to ask questions.</p>
        <p>Through out all of these conversations and readings I made sure to keep many organised notes in my database to be able to ask relevant questions or raise intersting points. I put a fair bit of effort in.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Angelicism Film01 Screening - August 10</h3>
        <p>10 hour film screenin ny art scene based collective - exploring the medium o the image, destroying linear time and embracing the meme compilation and smoothing of the brain.</p>
        <p>Great event, interesting people, alot of the the people I am friends with left for a party, I ended up staying, however these organisers and volunteers are artists themselves aswell; I could have struck up a conversation but i was more interested in watching the movie throughout. So i did. I think this was also noted, my friend Ella who runs the library portal noted to me at soft centre, "i think u were one of the only ones that made it through" and asked for my thoughts on the piece.</p>

        <h3>August 20th - Catherine Liu - Trauma culture: Private suffering and public life</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.monash.edu/muma/public-programs/previous/2025/trauma-culture-private-suffering-and-public-life">https://www.monash.edu/muma/public-programs/previous/2025/trauma-culture-private-suffering-and-public-life</a></p>
        <p>"US-based cultural theorist Catherine Liu, Professor of Film & Media Studies at the University of California, Irvine, and author of Virtue Hoarders: The Case Against the Professional Managerial Class"</p>
        <p>Catherine Liu was in Australia for a tour of talks that coincided with sort of the main funder // headline of her Australian tour in Australia at the Institute of modern art in Brisbane. This was apart of the current exhbition that is taking place between the - ### 29 June–22 September 2024. Curated by Stephanie Berlangieri, Angela Goddard, and Robert Leonard</p>
        <p>Stephanie Berlangieri, came down from brisbane with catherine to introduce and facilitate the conversations at the talk. Here I was a bit shy, enjoyed the lecture, one of my friends works with UnMagazine and we said hello to eachother briefly and I left.</p>
        <p>Catherine Liu is very much connected to a broader arts, media and academic scene globally. Catherine has just the other day had a podcast released with the aforementioned discord group moderator Joshua Citarella who is also showing works alongside Catherine as a part of the exhibition in brisbane</p>

        <h3>August 23, 2024 - "This Hideous Replica" Exhibition Opening</h3>
        <p>I was at uni and saw someone repost the information for this galery opening at RMIT; I thought this person i know called Emile had some work showing, After my morning class on friday I headed over to check it out and as I entered the gallery I took a duble look at the flags that were on the main entrance and it was drum roll... Joshua Citarellas flags of e-deologies online created through his research into politigram mainly teenage shitposters with extreme political ideologies, who may have in the past been just weird or nerdy kids, they find their groups and friends from radical posting..</p>
        <p>I spent my tuime in the exhibtion and found there was going to be a series of events that would tie in with the exhibtion and I decided I would go to every single one.</p>
        <p>Later that day there was the official opening of the show; I attended and mingled with friends and peers from rmit.</p>
        <p>I spoke with my friend Dr. Alison Bennett who introduced me to some more RMIT People.</p>
        <p>I also spoke with close friends Lucien and Nhu; Lucien is a phd researcher teaching Games Design students and Nhu is a PHD Student teaching in the MAGI program. I also spoke to my friends Audrey who I will mention later and Henry – multidisciplinary artist and a part of PSEUDO Studio.</p>

        <h3>Sunday 25th - MIFF with Eudgene and Audrey + Meeting people at drinks on rooftop.</h3>
        <p>On sunday I went to see a MIFF Film with my friends audrey and eudgene I wouldn't be putting this in here but within the context of the weekend and all that was about to be going on we ended up running into some other people audrey knows from sydney. After the movie we headed to rooftop bar at curtin house in the cbd - turns out that audreys friend lillli and Jemma;</p>
        <p>I hadn't met Jemma before but did know of them; I'm a fan of soft centre and have seen their name mentioned in the credits and on the page as being an organiser.</p>
        <p>For some context - Soft Center is an multidisciplinary arts collective and organisers famous for their headline show that was previously based in sydney taken from their site - " Described as 'ecstatic, extreme and staunchly experimental', SOFT CENTRE events are distinctively extra sensory. Since its inception at the Casula Powerhouse in 2017, SOFT CENTRE has championed the fringes of electronic music, sound art, contemporary dance, performance art, light works and new media art. Included in Resident Advisor's Top Ten festivals globally (June 2023) and winner of FBi Radio's Best Music Event (2017 & 2018), SOFT CENTE stands out for its cutting-edge cross-disciplinary programming, innovative use of unconventional public space and dedicated community.

        <h3>August 28 - Mochu: GREAT CHAIN OF STAINS OR INCOMPATIBLE RATIONALITIES ON THE WEB</h3>
        <p>28 AUG, 1-4PM</p>
        <p>FIRST SITE - Great reading group, very small room was able to talk with the artist surrounding ideas about neo-reactionary readings, this was a good opportunity, to chat with other likeminded people, alot of those present were rmit staff, some masters students and other art people I have seen around at similar workshops / events,</p>
        <p>It was especially intersting to have a conversation with mochu, we spoke there about various things and when I later saw him across the various events at the weekend, we had a chat and spoke about different things; interesting person, maybe i'll bump into him at a gallery show in berlin if i end up spending some time living / working / studying in germany.</p>

        <h3>Blindside Gallery Opening - Thursday 29th of august 6-8pm</h3>
        <p>This was a gallery show that my friend Audrey Jo Pfister curated.</p>
        <p>This show really was a fantastic opportunity for me as I have not got much experience exhibiting my works; also the artists I was showing the works alongside are still early career artists from australia but their recognition and envelopment into the arts world is much further than my own; some of the artists could also be said to be successful mid-career artists; showing and working on works around the globe mainly in collaboration with larger artists</p>
        <p>This was a great opportunity to meet my co-conspirators in the gallery space; discuss witht hem the works and mingle; some curators were down from brisbane and many ither people turned out for the show; I don't have much of an understanding of the scaffolding or pathway within arts in Melbourne but when discussing this show with friends of mine in the BFA program they mentioned it's a great opportunity;</p>
        <p>In alignment with this showcase I also went back the following week and made sure to document the works in the gallery and share those outputs with the other artists in the show; I borrowed a really fancy giant camera from university, exported them at HD quality for posting and sending to them on Instagram and uploaded the full quality raw files toan album on flickr so they could all access the images;; I think despite me being a really young artist and just a short 60 second single channel video work this was a nice gesture to show my appreciation and to show that I am a bit of a fanboy of the others works.</p>
        <p>I collated these images into a short edit, created a datamosh video from some videos i took in the space, posted a photo of my own work and the main poster image all in 1 insagram post which was        <p>which was then reshared by several people, mainly the little quick edit of the photos as it was a nice way to represent the show. - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_klEn-pvUF/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">link to insta post</a></p>

        <p>After this gallery Show i headed to miscellanea for the artists talks / screenings co-hosted by RMIT and DOGMILK Productions who host a short film / experimental movie night every second Thursday I'm pretty sure.</p>
        <p>While i was on my way down i had become friends with this sydney artist called yanti; we had alot of intertextual niche interests that came up that synced up; we ended up heading over to Miscellania after the gallery opening and talked more of her studies, travels, studying art in Germany and doing an artist's residency in china soon ; it's interesting and inspiring to hear about other people's journeys through their artistic careers.</p>

        <h3>AUGUST 31st Soft Centre + Design Work $ 😊</h3>
        <p>On august 31st I was set to volunteer at soft center for bump in at 3:40. however earlier during the day my friend audrey messaged me out of nowhere and asked if i was free at around 11am and if i knew how to use illustrator. I responded yes and she asked if i could jump online and do some last minute edits to the timetable files for SOFT Centre. I was sent the files and thorsten who is the main organiser alongside jemma sent me some instructions I worked on this, arrived at the venue, at 3:30 additionally finished up the last minute changes and then helped with bump in. this gave me some insight into the speed and the complexity of the operation. in the office there were about 6 peopl, organising, taking phone calls, liasing with artists etc. organising a lunch run, speaking with the venue etc, there was a large team of security, volunteers, staff, all organised for the event. It took me a bit by surprise just the speed and professionalism within this organisation or collective. It was then wonderful to see it all come together and culminate in the night.</p>

        <h3>Paris Online  - New web development opportunity working with an archive of artists works and creating a display for a digital exhibition.</h3>
        <p>After posting my portfolio to my instagram story I had an old friend that I had met when she was on exchange to Australia when I was in high school message me and ask if could develop a website for a project she has been working on. The new site will be mainly video art focused with 7 contributing artists.</p>
        <p>The current site is available here - <a href="https://www.parisonline.org/">https://www.parisonline.org/</a></p>
        <p>I have been wanting to create a website for someone else to be able to use their portfolio in collaboration to make a beautiful site. This is beyond perfect as it gives me an opportunity to think about curation and the display of video art online. And work alongside them to create a thorough archive of their previous works</p>
