        <p><a href="https://lucashorta.com" target="_blank">Visit My Final Portfolio</a></p>


        <p>Throughout this semester I have developed a personal portfolio site with HTML, CSS, JS and Three.js.</p>

        <p>Initially, in previous years I had a very fast-paced interactive portfolio that I felt was far too overwhelming and didn't reflect the professionalized approach I was thinking of taking in regard to my work as it has been evolving and as I move into my final semester, seeking internships and entering into the design industry as a whole.</p>

        <p>The lens of my portfolio is straddled between having a personal creative / artistic practice that I would like to develop further, apply for residencies etc. and a professional practice where I would like to find full-time employment at a digital design agency that makes use of emergent technology in their workplace.</p>

        <p>Through this lens I decided that I would completely redesign my portfolio and thus began by dissecting sites that I think represent an artistic vision and aesthetic that suits my creative practice while maintaining a professional tone.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Terrain.earth Site</h3>

        <iframe src="https://terrain.earth/index" style="aspect-ratio: 16/9;" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p><a href="https://terrain.earth/index" target="_blank">Visit Terrain.earth</a></p>

        <p>Terrain is a bookshop and coworking space in Melbourne on Brunswick St in Fitzroy. This site approaches web design in a way that I love; useful, interesting and fun; a practical code experiment. The site brings a clean aesthetic that is textural and connects to the ethos of the brand.</p>

        <blockquote>"An initiative that creates playful physical and digital spaces to remind humans that they are embedded in a more-than-human world[*^](https://terrain.earth/manifesto)."</blockquote>

        <p>Their design ethos centers on being through an educated lens, to stay mindful of their surroundings, to stay clear. The stark white background and mixed use of bold headers and ultralight paragraphs bring a professionalized aesthetic as textures break through the page in a natural way.</p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/yxDFMZa.png" alt="Terrain.earth screenshot 3">


        <p>An aside that I find exceptionally interesting is that they renewably self-host their site. I wish that I could do this if I had the means. I would set up a small Raspberry Pi self-hosted from home; however, living in a sharehouse this is a little difficult. I do however take an anti-anti-technical approach in my work and this is reflected via coding the site myself and hosting via GitHub. Antitechnicalism is where people increasingly rely on mediated services for tasks such as coding, design, and game asset creation.</p>

        <h3>Gesture Systems</h3>

        <iframe src="https://gesturesystems.studio/" style="aspect-ratio: 16/9;" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p><a href="https://gesturesystems.studio/" target="_blank">Explore Gesture Systems</a></p>

        <p>From Gesture Systems IG Bio self-described as:</p>
        <p>Identity, 3D & Motion Studio<br>
        Perth, AUS / Tokyo, JPN</p>

        <p>This studio's work between 3D, photography, mixed media overall brand image is incredibly compelling to me; as someone with these interdisciplinary digital skills I would aim for work that lies in a similar vein as I begin to position myself for more client-focused or workplace-driven design work.</p>

        <p>The site is simple and concise managing a body of work in a table setting which would be easily manageable; HTML templates for structure are used throughout the rest of the site and the repeated design layouts for the previous work is clean and very usable for updating. As you may notice there is a feature in the site that I pulled inspiration directly from; the image previews of the works popping up in the bottom right-hand corner of the page. This provides a glance at the imagery of the work without having to open up or obstruct the current view.</p>

        <p>The form of the 3 concise categories is effective; however, I have utilized 4 to be able to show in greater detail at a glance the area of expertise and the software I utilized to be able to showcase my proficiency across a range of mediums when the user is on the main page layout of my site.</p>

        <h3>Cory Arcangel - Portfolio</h3>

        <iframe src="https://coryarcangel.com/" style="aspect-ratio: 16/9;" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p><a href="https://coryarcangel.com/" target="_blank">View Cory Arcangel's Portfolio</a></p>

        <p>Another portfolio that I initially drew inspiration from was Cory Arcangel's. Cory is a digital artist who is very famous and has shown works at the likes of MOMA and other major international galleries.</p>

        <p>Cory is situated in the early post-net era at least initially and his work has mainly stayed close to this. The continuation of nostalgia not just for commercial electronics of the 90s but a nostalgia for the post-net and net art movement itself.</p>

        <p>Cory's site is reflective of this tone; minimal, clean, as if I've just dialed in (as if I understand what that's like lol). This clean layout shows explicitly his attitudes and approach -</p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/q1HRTTs.png" alt="Cory Arcangel's site screenshot 1">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TCsQDlZ.png" alt="Cory Arcangel's site screenshot 2">

        <p>It might be because I follow him and have been a fan for a while; but it's just so Cory. The shrugging face emoji in the corner is perfect and language such as stuff and things brings his American boyish way of presentation with his scruffy hair and blog era aesthetics.</p>

        <p>This is a large inspiration point for conveying not just aesthetic but attitude in a site. Some of my initial mockups were more bare and initially looked closer to this.</p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/IJmhtpX.png" alt="Initial mockup">

        <p>However I realize I am not a net artist; I'm a Gen-Z digital 3D artist, coder, and I should integrate these skills in a way that maintains a minimalist approach while reflecting who I am; and in that way I specifically took note from the methods of presentation via Cory and reinterpreted them through my work and my site.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Initial Portfolio + Iterating</h3>

        <p>As I have shown the work and progress documenting my thinking and the iterations of my website I will briefly showcase some iterations of my final site to refresh how I have come to my final portfolio as it stands.</p>

        <p>My initial site from the previous semester that I created using HTML and HTML Canvas for the moving icons. Reflecting on this site I found it too busy and difficult to use, it also had limited usability on mobile as some of the interaction design was based around the on-hover event.</p>

        <iframe src="https://lucash0rta.github.io/im2350/The%20portfolio%20new/index.html" style="aspect-ratio: 16/9;" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p><a href="https://lucash0rta.github.io/im2350/The%20portfolio%20new/index.html" target="_blank">View My Initial Portfolio</a></p>

        <p>My first iterations and testing with the new grid format I had been developing is below. I received feedback that it was too simplistic and felt more like a CV than a portfolio site. I needed to add some spice.</p>

        <iframe src="https://lucash0rta.github.io/Portfolio/PP_PortfolioSite_Plain/index.html" style="aspect-ratio: 16/9;" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p><a href="https://lucash0rta.github.io/Portfolio/PP_PortfolioSite_Plain/index.html" target="_blank">See My Portfolio Iteration</a></p>

        <p>And finally we have the final iteration; I'd like to highlight here some final touches and changes I have made to develop my portfolio in the previous weeks as I have received feedback from peers.</p>

        <p>I have added a contact form in the about page of the site and applied relevant styling so that it fits with the overall tone and colors of my site.</p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ITgRGoE.png" alt="Contact form">

        <p>I have also edited my bio so that it presents from a third person and have added the last section which was similar to what I had sent a couple of times in emails while applying for internships and had been hearing back. This sort of development of wording as iteration depending on if I'm hearing back has been an interesting experiment and so I reflected some of this language here in specifically noting "He is excited about the opportunity to develop these skills further in a team environment, where he can both contribute and grow."</p>

        <p>I also went and added some previous work from when I was younger. Converting the motion graphics posters I made for some event management work into GIFs so that I could host them for free up on Giphy and have them load quickly onto my site. Despite this being a long time ago it does highlight my experience with running Facebook ad campaigns and targeting specific demographics using their AdSense toolkits.</p>

        <h3>Updates on Internship Applications and the Future</h3>

        <p>As I reflect on my portfolio and the work conducted through the professional practice class I'm grateful that I've had the time to research more in-depth the various workplaces that I have an interest in applying to.</p>

        <p>At this moment I have secured an internship with Tag agency in Balaclava - this was not one of the places I had conducted research for however I think it will be a good fit for me.</p>

        <p>I did reach out to the agencies I had conducted research on however have not heard back; I was quite optimistic at first however understand it really has to be the right email sent at the right time for the company especially when it comes to a short WIL placement with a university agreement.</p>

        <p>I have also been in contact with Terrain which I mentioned above as a major inspiration for my portfolio site. This is mainly a bookstore however I believe they are going to be transitioning into a client-based studio in addition and have been advertising for a few positions. Within the bookstore they have works from people such as Hito Steyerl, Mindy Seu and many other authors; I appreciate the range of books, the aesthetic style and the ethos of Terrain as far as I have seen it in person and online and will be having a meeting about interning as a "Digital Producer" this coming week on Thursday.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Final Reflection</h3>

        <p>Through my iterative design process, I have developed my site with feedback from peers, friends, and even from a professional interview. Through this iterative design, I believe I have developed a site that reflects my personal brand/identity that I have created works surrounding. My interests and skills are at the forefront of the site while maintaining a sense of personal touches with things like my up-to-date reading list.</p>

        <p>The iterative process was usability and information driven first and through the semester leaned more into an aesthetically minded approach. I'm satisfied with the final outcome as it feels like a reflection of where I am and where I strive to place myself.</p>
